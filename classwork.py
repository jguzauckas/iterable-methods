# Create a list with 20 random numbers with values between 0 and 10.
# Print out the list once it is completed.


# Print out the sum, maximum value, and minimum value of our list with
# our new methods!


# Print out the number of times that the number `5` shows up in the list.


# Sort the list in ascending order and print the result.


# Now sort the list in descending order and print the result.


# Check if the number 0 appears in the list and print the result as a boolean.


# Print the indices (index) at which the number 8 appears in the list.
# Make sure it prints all the indices it shows up at, and not just the first!
